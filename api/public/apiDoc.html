    <p>
      When you are making an API call, through the use of glitch.com that we are currently using, we have set up a page that 
      will demonstrate how to GET, POST, and DELETE with the API. On the page that we have set up, you will see a dropdown box 
      that has those 3 options. Next you will see “<strong>api/</strong>“ and then a text box for the user to input what they are 
      searching for. There will also be a button to submit your request. Below is a text box that you use when you are going to 
      POST information. The shaded area below will print all of the results that you asked for using GET. When you DELETE, it 
      will return the object with all of its data to the shaded output area. 
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="sub" id="g">GET</h2>
    <p>
      When making a GET request, all you have to do on this setup that we have, you need to make sure that the GET option is 
      selected (this is the default setting). After you have GET selected, then you can type in the text field the item you are 
      looking for. For example, if you want to find the courses, you will need to have “<strong>api/courses</strong>" written 
      before you hit enter or the submit button. Remember, “api/“ is already written. All you need to do is write 
      “<strong>courses</strong>” if you want to find the course list.<br>
      If you want to find the quizzes in a course, you need to add a little bit more to what was already written. You need to 
      search for the courses first. After that, you need to pick a course you want to go into before you can find the quizzes. 
      After you picked a course, you will search for the quizzes. This will be written as 
      “<strong>api/courses/CS4450/quizzes</strong>”. This will give you all the quizzes within the CS4450 class. If you want to 
      pick a different class, just change the “<strong>CS4450</strong>” part but leave everything else the same. To access the quiz itself and 
      to get the questions, you need to add even more to the end of the API call. Once you have the courses list, the specified 
      course, and the list of quizzes, you can type in the quiz id followed by questions to get all of the questions from that 
      specific quiz. For example, “<strong>api/courses/CS4450/quizzes/5efa978c92c1290235963112/questions</strong>” will give you 
      the questions to the test quiz that are in the CS4450 course.

    <h2 class="sub" id="p">POST</h2>
    <p>
      When making a POST request, you do a lot of the same things that you do when making a GET request. You need to make sure 
      that you are specifying where you want to go. So if you want to create a new course, you need to have 
      “<strong>api/courses</strong>" written out first. Once you have that, within the body text field with the brackets, you 
      need to be careful about how to insert the data for the new course. For example, with adding a course, you must have POST 
      selected instead of GET, and then you would write out <strong>{“courseName”: “name of course”}</strong>.<br> 
      Once you are done with that, you will hit the submit button or press Enter and it will activate POST and then will put the 
      new course in with the list of courses. To create a new quiz, the process is almost the exact same. The differences are 
      that you need to specify which course you want and then access the quizzes. So have 
      “<strong>api/courses/CS4450/quizzes</strong>” written out. Once that is written, then you can start to add the data into 
      the quiz. So you would have: 
      <strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          {“title”: “quiz title”,<br> 
          “questions”: [
          <ul>
            <li>
              {
              <ul>
                <li>
                  “question”: “some question”,<br>
                  “answers”: [
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      “answer 1”,<br>
                      “answer 2”
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  ]
                </li>
              </ul>
              },<br>
              {
              <ul>
                <li>
                  repeat the process for however many questions and answers you want
                </li>
              </ul>
              }
            </li>
          </ul>
          ]
        </li>
        }
      </ul>
      </strong>
    This is what you would write to make a new quiz. You would just need to change the values to be what you need them to be.
    So anything after the colons is what you would change.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="sub" id="d">DELETE</h2>
    <p>
      When it comes to deleting, this process needs to be very careful. If you want to delete a specific quiz, then you need to 
      make sure that you are targeting the correct one. Make sure all spelling is correct. If you wanted to delete a specific 
      question within a quiz, you would need to specify the course, quiz id, and the question index that needs to be deleted. 
      For example, “<strong>/api/courses/CS4450/quizzes/5efa978c92c1290235963112/questions/1</strong>” will grab the very first 
      question within the quiz whose id that you specified.<br>
      Once that is in place, you will make sure DELETE is selected and then hit Enter or press submit. If you did a GET request 
      first to make sure that you are going to delete the correct thing, you would have the results within the shaded area. If 
      that is the correct thing that you want to get rid of, you would have the same thing written down and then have DELETE 
      selected. Once you hit submit or Enter, what is displayed in the shaded area will show you what was deleted. If you didn’t 
      change anything after the GET request, then nothing will change. If you have all of the quizzes pulled up before you delete 
      that question, it will then display the question that was deleted. If you wanted to delete a specific course, then you 
      would write “<strong>api/courses/CS4450</strong>” and then ave DELETE selected.<br>
      If you deleted the entire course, all of the contents would be displayed within the shaded area. Same rules apply if you 
      wanted to delete a quiz. If you wanted to delete a specific quiz, then you would have something like 
      “<strong>/api/courses/CS4450/quizzes/5efa978c92c1290235963112</strong>” to pull that specific quiz so then you can delete 
      it from the database.
