    <h2>Signup Endpoint: (POST request)</h2>
    <p>
      This will register a new user with a username, their first name and last name, a password, and the option of making them an 
      administrator within the system. There are 6 different parameters within the Signup Endpoint. Those are the user object, 
      the username, first name, last name, password, and the isAdmin option being on or off. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The user object will store the information provided by the user within itself (i.e. username, first name, last name, etc.). 
      The username, first name, last name, and password are all string values. The isAdmin is a boolean since it is a simple 
      true/false button. 
    </p>
    <p>
      When the user is registering a new account, if there is anything missing, i.e. one of the fields is empty, other than the 
      isAdmin, then you will be given an error message saying that one or more of the fields is empty. Again, isAdmin will not 
      affect the registering of the user and is completely optional. If there already is a user with the same username in the 
      database already, it will return an error message telling you that the user already exists. If there are no issues, then 
      the user will be created by using the “let newUser = new User(user)” line of code.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the user creates their own password tied to the account, the endpoint will take that and hash the password so that it 
      will then be encrypted to prevent hackers from getting in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the user is registered and the password is hashed, the “newUser.save()” function will trigger and will save the user 
      with all of their credentials into the database to be accessed at a later time. As long as the username and the hashed 
      password match each other in the database, the user will be logged in and no errors will generate. If something were to go 
      wrong, i.e. the username or password is incorrect or a field is empty, the appropriate error message will be displayed 
      informing the user of what is wrong. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>Authenticate Endpoint: (POST request)</h2>
    <p>
      If the credentials of the user are correct, then the Authenticate Endpoint will return true and the user will be 
      authenticated into the system. There are 3 parameters within this endpoint. Those are the user object, the username and 
      the password. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The user object will take the username and password provided by the user and check the database to ensure that they are 
      the same username and password that were offered during the Signup Endpoint. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The username and password fields are still string values. It will be the same username and password that were used in the 
      registering of the user. 
    </p>
    <p>
      When the user goes to log in, it will check both of the string values that are provided by the user and will check the 
      database for matching string values as well as hashed values. If there is a match, then the endpoint will return true and 
      the user will be logged in using the credentials that they used. If there is a field that is empty, then an error message 
      will be displayed informing the user of what is wrong. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The User.findOne() function will check the database for the username that is specified. If the username is found, it will 
      compare the hashed password to it as well and if they match,  the user will be logged in. If the username doesn’t match 
      any in the database, or if the hashed password for the matched username is incorrect, then an error message will be 
      displayed. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The let token = jwt.sign() function will assign a JSON web token to the user that has an expiration time of 5 hours from 
      the time that it was created. The console.log method will print out the JSON web token in the web console and will show 
      what the actual token is.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Deauthenticate Endpoint: (GET request)</h2>
    <p>
      The Deauthenticate Endpoint will make it so that the user session becomes invalid or the JSON web token becomes invalid.
