Figma is a program used to lay out what the possible user interfaces would look like. If you would like to learn how to use Figma please just google Figma tutorials. It is a pretty easy program to learn.  

Please keep in mind that in order to maintain a constant theme you will have to communicate with the other groups of this project. The main layout colors/styles/fonts and everything are kept in the css file called ‘ styleQuizCleanUp.css’.
